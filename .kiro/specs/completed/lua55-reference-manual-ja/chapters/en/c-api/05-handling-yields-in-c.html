<h2>4.5 &ndash; <a name="4.5">Handling Yields in C</a></h2>

<p>
Internally, Lua uses the C <code>longjmp</code> facility to yield a coroutine.
Therefore, if a C&nbsp;function <code>foo</code> calls an API function
and this API function yields
(directly or indirectly by calling another function that yields),
Lua cannot return to <code>foo</code> any more,
because the <code>longjmp</code> removes its frame from the C&nbsp;stack.


<p>
To avoid this kind of problem,
Lua raises an error whenever it tries to yield across an API call,
except for three functions:
<a href="#lua_yieldk"><code>lua_yieldk</code></a>, <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a>, and <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>.
All those functions receive a <em>continuation function</em>
(as a parameter named <code>k</code>) to continue execution after a yield.


<p>
We need to set some terminology to explain continuations.
We have a C&nbsp;function called from Lua which we will call
the <em>original function</em>.
This original function then calls one of those three functions in the C API,
which we will call the <em>callee function</em>,
that then yields the current thread.
This can happen when the callee function is <a href="#lua_yieldk"><code>lua_yieldk</code></a>,
or when the callee function is either <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a> or <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>
and the function called by them yields.


<p>
Suppose the running thread yields while executing the callee function.
After the thread resumes,
it eventually will finish running the callee function.
However,
the callee function cannot return to the original function,
because its frame in the C&nbsp;stack was destroyed by the yield.
Instead, Lua calls a <em>continuation function</em>,
which was given as an argument to the callee function.
As the name implies,
the continuation function should continue the task
of the original function.


<p>
As an illustration, consider the following function:

<pre>
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       status = lua_pcall(L, n, m, h);  /* calls Lua */
       ...     /* code 2 */
     }
</pre><p>
Now we want to allow
the Lua code being run by <a href="#lua_pcall"><code>lua_pcall</code></a> to yield.
First, we can rewrite our function like here:

<pre>
     int k (lua_State *L, int status, lua_KContext ctx) {
       ...  /* code 2 */
     }
     
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       return k(L, lua_pcall(L, n, m, h), ctx);
     }
</pre><p>
In the above code,
the new function <code>k</code> is a
<em>continuation function</em> (with type <a href="#lua_KFunction"><code>lua_KFunction</code></a>),
which should do all the work that the original function
was doing after calling <a href="#lua_pcall"><code>lua_pcall</code></a>.
Now, we must inform Lua that it must call <code>k</code> if the Lua code
being executed by <a href="#lua_pcall"><code>lua_pcall</code></a> gets interrupted in some way
(errors or yielding),
so we rewrite the code as here,
replacing <a href="#lua_pcall"><code>lua_pcall</code></a> by <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>:

<pre>
     int original_function (lua_State *L) {
       ...     /* code 1 */
       return k(L, lua_pcallk(L, n, m, h, ctx2, k), ctx1);
     }
</pre><p>
Note the external, explicit call to the continuation:
Lua will call the continuation only if needed, that is,
in case of errors or resuming after a yield.
If the called function returns normally without ever yielding,
<a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a> (and <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a>) will also return normally.
(Of course, instead of calling the continuation in that case,
you can do the equivalent work directly inside the original function.)


<p>
Besides the Lua state,
the continuation function has two other parameters:
the final status of the call and the context value (<code>ctx</code>) that
was passed originally to <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>.
Lua does not use this context value;
it only passes this value from the original function to the
continuation function.
For <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>,
the status is the same value that would be returned by <a href="#lua_pcallk"><code>lua_pcallk</code></a>,
except that it is <a href="#pdf-LUA_YIELD"><code>LUA_YIELD</code></a> when being executed after a yield
(instead of <a href="#pdf-LUA_OK"><code>LUA_OK</code></a>).
For <a href="#lua_yieldk"><code>lua_yieldk</code></a> and <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a>,
the status is always <a href="#pdf-LUA_YIELD"><code>LUA_YIELD</code></a> when Lua calls the continuation.
(For these two functions,
Lua will not call the continuation in case of errors,
because they do not handle errors.)
Similarly, when using <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a>,
you should call the continuation function
with <a href="#pdf-LUA_OK"><code>LUA_OK</code></a> as the status.
(For <a href="#lua_yieldk"><code>lua_yieldk</code></a>, there is not much point in calling
directly the continuation function,
because <a href="#lua_yieldk"><code>lua_yieldk</code></a> usually does not return.)


<p>
Lua treats the continuation function as if it were the original function.
The continuation function receives the same Lua stack
from the original function,
in the same state it would be if the callee function had returned.
(For instance,
after a <a href="#lua_callk"><code>lua_callk</code></a> the function and its arguments are
removed from the stack and replaced by the results from the call.)
It also has the same upvalues.
Whatever it returns is handled by Lua as if it were the return
of the original function.
