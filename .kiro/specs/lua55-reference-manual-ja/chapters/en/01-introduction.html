<p>
Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
It supports procedural programming,
object-oriented programming, functional programming,
data-driven programming, and data description.


<p>
Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.
Lua is dynamically typed,
runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based
virtual machine,
and has automatic memory management with
a generational garbage collection,
making it ideal for configuration, scripting,
and rapid prototyping.


<p>
Lua is implemented as a library, written in <em>clean C</em>,
the common subset of standard&nbsp;C and C++.
The Lua distribution includes a host program called <code>lua</code>,
which uses the Lua library to offer a complete,
standalone Lua interpreter,
for interactive or batch use.
Lua is intended to be used both as a powerful, lightweight,
embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one,
and as a powerful but lightweight and efficient stand-alone language.


<p>
As an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program:
it works <em>embedded</em> in a host client,
called the <em>embedding program</em> or simply the <em>host</em>.
(Frequently, this host is the stand-alone <code>lua</code> program.)
The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code,
can write and read Lua variables,
and can register C&nbsp;functions to be called by Lua code.
Through the use of C&nbsp;functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with
a wide range of different domains,
thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.


<p>
Lua is free software,
and is provided as usual with no guarantees,
as stated in its license.
The implementation described in this manual is available
at Lua's official web site, <code>www.lua.org</code>.


<p>
Like any other reference manual,
this document is dry in places.
